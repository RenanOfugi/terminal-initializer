# ![terminal-initializer] (http://icons.iconarchive.com/icons/alecive/flatwoken/48/Apps-Terminal-icon.png) Terminal Initializer
Terminal Initializer is a small program made in Bash to display random text files in Terminal.

The program comes by default with four examples of "Tux ASCII Art", but serves any hint (text) you want to show at the log in of your terminal, even jokes. 

Just put some text file in the folder "terminalInitializer" located in your HOME folder and ready.
