Description: Terminal Initializer
 Terminal Initializer is a small program made in Bash to display random 
 text files in Terminal.
 .
 The program comes by default with four examples of "Tux ASCII Art", 
 but serves any hint (text) you want to show at the log in of your 
 terminal, even jokes. 
 .
 Just put some text file in the folder "terminalInitializer" located 
 in your HOME folder and ready.
